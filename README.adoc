# Unisrc

Unisrc is a framework that runs on the LAMP and WEBR stack.

* LAMP: _Linux with Apache, MySQL & PHP_
* WEBR:	_Web Browser with modern HTML, CSS & JS_

This is a first mandatory install to further explore anything Unisrc.
This repository is often referred in documentation by `UBS` (_Unisrc Base Server_), which shifts the context to the role it fulfills.

`UBS` manages install, setup and updates of `UCRs` (_Unisrc Compliant Repositories_).
 A `UCR` is of a design that `UBS` knows and hosts, much like an OS hosts APPs.
But next to being an APP, a `UCR` can be anything, like a module, api, library, or even one class, function or an asset.

`UCRs` will be git cloned inside Unisrc/ucr/* and then interlaced inside `UST` by symbolic links,
so all the UCR sources become part of the Unisrc environment, addressing and loading model.
